# Crop-Prediction-System
The Crop Prediction System will predict the best suitable crop for a particular type of soil based on the properties of soil. It uses Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the crops. It also draws a comparison among different types of Machine Learning Classification Algorithms best suited for such predictions.
